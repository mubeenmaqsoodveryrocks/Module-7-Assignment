I made sure to follow the UI State Management tasks. Or at least I tried.
I modify the "Major" field with fields CS, CPIS, English. I made sure to use 'enum'.
I added "import CSV file" and "export CSV file".
I completed the signup page functionality as well as put the username and password upon sign-in in the Preference file.
The additional changes are needed because they will help improve the app, they will give us more options other than edit and delete, they will allow people to put in their login information such as their username and password, and they will help set the stage of what we would want to do or how we would want to use the app.
